\section{Applications and Use Cases}
\label{sec:applications}

This section explores practical applications for both \supra{} and \zennano{} models, analyzing their deployment scenarios, integration strategies, and real-world performance in various domains.

\subsection{Educational Applications}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Tutoring}

\supra{}'s transparent reasoning makes it particularly suitable for educational contexts:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Interactive Problem Solving Example:}
\begin{quote}
\footnotesize
\textit{Student: I'm confused about solving quadratic equations. Can you show me how to solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0?}

\textbf{Supra Nexus o1:}
<thinking>
This is a quadratic equation in standard form ax² + bx + c = 0 where a=1, b=-5, c=6.
I can solve this using:
1. Factoring (if possible)
2. Quadratic formula
3. Completing the square

Let me try factoring first. I need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5.
-2 × -3 = 6 ✓
-2 + (-3) = -5 ✓

So the factored form is (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
</thinking>

I'll solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0 step by step:

**Method 1: Factoring**
1. I need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5
2. Those numbers are -2 and -3 because (-2) × (-3) = 6 and (-2) + (-3) = -5
3. So: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
4. Therefore: x = 2 or x = 3

**Verification:** 
- For x = 2: (2)² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
- For x = 3: (3)² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓

Key educational benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step-by-Step Learning}: Students see the complete problem-solving process
    \item \textbf{Error Prevention}: Explicit verification steps teach checking habits  
    \item \textbf{Method Comparison}: Multiple solution approaches are demonstrated
    \item \textbf{Conceptual Understanding}: Reasoning reveals underlying mathematical principles
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Code Learning and Debugging}

Programming education benefits significantly from transparent reasoning:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Code debugging with transparent reasoning,label=lst:debugging-example]
Student: This Python code isn't working. Can you help?

def factorial(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        result = result * i
    return result

Supra Response:
<thinking>
Looking at this factorial function, I can see several issues:
1. result is initialized to 0, but should be 1 (0 * anything = 0)
2. range(n) goes from 0 to n-1, but factorial needs 1 to n
3. Multiplying by 0 in the first iteration will always give 0

The correct approach:
- Initialize result to 1
- Use range(1, n+1) to get 1, 2, ..., n
- Handle edge case where n = 0
</thinking>

I found several bugs in your factorial function:

**Issues:**
1. `result = 0` should be `result = 1` (multiplying by 0 gives 0)
2. `range(n)` gives 0 to n-1, but we need 1 to n
3. Missing edge case for n = 0

**Corrected version:**
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result = result * i
    return result
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Scientific Research Support}

\end{table>

\subsubsection{Mathematical Proof Assistance}

Complex mathematical reasoning benefits from transparent proof construction:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Proof Construction Example:}
\begin{quote}
\footnotesize
\textit{Researcher: Help me prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.}

\textbf{Supra Response:}
<thinking>
I'll use proof by contradiction. The strategy is:
1. Assume √2 is rational
2. Express it as a fraction in lowest terms
3. Show this leads to a contradiction
4. Therefore √2 must be irrational

Let me work through this systematically...
</thinking>

**Proof that √2 is irrational (by contradiction):**

1. **Assumption**: Suppose √2 is rational
2. **Implication**: Then √2 = p/q where p,q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0, and gcd(p,q) = 1
3. **Squaring**: 2 = p²/q², so p² = 2q²
4. **Analysis**: Since p² = 2q², p² is even, therefore p is even
5. **Substitution**: Let p = 2k for some integer k, then (2k)² = 2q²
6. **Simplification**: 4k² = 2q², so q² = 2k²
7. **Contradiction**: Now q² is even, so q is even
8. **Conclusion**: Both p and q are even, contradicting gcd(p,q) = 1

Therefore, √2 is irrational. ∎
