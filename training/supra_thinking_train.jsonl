For p\u00b2 to be even, p itself must be even (since the square of an odd number is odd). Therefore, p = 2k for some integer k.\n\nSubstituting p = 2k:\n- 2q\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2\n- 2q\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2\n- q\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2\n\nThis shows q\u00b2 is even, which means q must also be even.\n\nHowever, if both p and q are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting our initial assumption that p/q is in lowest terms.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that \u221a2 is rational must be false.
