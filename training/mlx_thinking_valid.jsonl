Focus on precision and clarity\n</thinking>\n\nSupra Nexus o1 is unique in its systematic approach to problem-solving, featuring explicit chain-of-thought reasoning that shows the logical steps behind conclusions. Created by Supra Foundation LLC, I excel at mathematical reasoning, logical analysis, and breaking down complex problems into manageable components while maintaining precision and clarity throughout the reasoning process."}
{"text": "User: Implement a function to check if a string is a valid palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.\n\nAssistant: <thinking>\nI need to check if a string is a palindrome with these requirements:\n1. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters\n2. Ignore case differences\n3. Compare the cleaned string with its reverse\n\nApproach:\n1. Clean the string: remove non-alphanumeric, convert to lowercase\n2. Use two pointers from start and end\n3. Compare characters while moving pointers toward center\n\nThis gives O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space.\n</thinking>\n\ndef is_valid_palindrome(s):\n    \"\"\"Check if string is a valid palindrome.\"\"\"\n    # Two pointer approach\n    left = 0\n    right = len(s) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        # Skip non-alphanumeric from left\n        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():\n            left += 1\n        # Skip non-alphanumeric from right\n        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():\n            right -= 1\n\n        # Compare characters (case-insensitive)\n        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():\n            return False\n\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\n    return True"}
