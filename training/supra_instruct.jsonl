When you measure a property of one entangled particle, you instantly know the corresponding property of its partner.\n\nThis phenomenon, which Einstein famously called \"spooky action at a distance,\" has been experimentally verified countless times and forms the foundation for emerging technologies like quantum computing and quantum cryptography."}]}

The \"red flowers\" mentioned in premise 2 could be entirely different types (tulips, carnations, poppies, etc.) while all roses could be white, yellow, pink, or any other color.\n\nFor this conclusion to be valid, we would need an additional premise directly stating that some roses are red, or that the red flowers mentioned include roses."}]}

Feed algorithm training data\n2. Algorithm identifies patterns and relationships\n3. Creates a model that can make predictions\n4. Test and refine the model\n\n**Applications:** Image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection, and much more.\n\nThe power of machine learning lies in its ability to handle complex patterns that would be impossible to code manually, and to improve performance as more data becomes available."}]}
