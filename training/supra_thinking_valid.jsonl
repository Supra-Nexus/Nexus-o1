All roses are flowers (Roses \u2286 Flowers)\n2.

In Scenario B, no roses fade quickly, even though some flowers do.\n\nTherefore, we CANNOT logically conclude that some roses fade quickly. This would be a logical fallacy - specifically, the fallacy of the undistributed middle.\n</thinking>\n\nNo, we cannot conclude that some roses fade quickly. While all roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, it's possible that only non-rose flowers fade quickly."}]}
