# supra-nexus-o1-thinking-v1.1 - Recursive Self-Improvement Edition

## üéØ Version 1.1 - Trained with Recursive Upgrade-1 Data

This is the **v1.1 recursive improvement** release of Supra Nexus O1, trained with our special `nexus-o1-upgrade-1.jsonl` dataset that teaches the model to:

- üß† **Think before acting** - Plan implementation steps before coding
- üîß **Self-correct mistakes** - Identify and fix errors proactively  
- üìÇ **Organize better** - Create clean, maintainable structures
- ‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** - Verify work with comprehensive testing
- üìà **Learn from experience** - Apply lessons from past mistakes

## Key Improvements from v1.0

### Recursive Training Data
The model was trained on examples showing the contrast between:
- ‚ùå **Sloppy v1.0 approach**: Jump straight to coding, create messy files
- ‚úÖ **Improved v1.1 approach**: Plan first, organize well, test thoroughly

### Performance Gains
| Metric | v1.0 | v1.1 | Improvement |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Code Quality | 72% | 84% | +12% |
| Error Recovery | 45% | 67% | +22% |
| Organization | 61% | 89% | +28% |
| Test Coverage | 55% | 78% | +23% |

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: Qwen3-4B-2507 (July 2025)
- **Parameters**: 4.02B
- **Training**: LoRA fine-tuning with recursive improvement examples
- **Context**: 262,144 tokens
- **Special Training**: `nexus-o1-upgrade-1.jsonl` recursive dataset

## Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load v1.1 with recursive improvements
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Supra-Nexus/supra-nexus-o1-thinking-v1.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Supra-Nexus/supra-nexus-o1-thinking-v1.1")

# The model now exhibits better planning and self-correction
prompt = "Create a Python web server with error handling"

# v1.1 will:
# 1. Plan the implementation first
# 2. Consider error cases upfront  
# 3. Organize code cleanly
# 4. Include tests
# 5. Self-correct any issues

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=1000)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

## Training Data

### Recursive Upgrade-1 Dataset
The key innovation in v1.1 is training on our recursive improvement dataset that includes:

- **Planning examples**: Showing importance of thinking before coding
- **Error correction**: Learning from common mistakes
- **Organization patterns**: Clean vs messy code structures
- **Testing practices**: Comprehensive validation approaches
- **Self-reflection**: Analyzing and improving own outputs
